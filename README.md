# minitest-matchers

## Warning

Don't use it! Writing simple assertions (and Minitest way of transforming them to expectations) is almost always a better idea anyway. Work with your favourite library authors to start with assertions and add matchers for convenience and not the other way around. Keep it simple.

## Description

minitest-matchers adds support for RSpec/Shoulda-style matchers to
minitest/unit and minitest/spec.

More information about matchers can be found here:

* https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations
* http://railscasts.com/episodes/157-rspec-matchers-macros

For use with Rails check out (ValidAttribute + Capybara):

* https://github.com/wojtekmach/minitest-rails-example

## Features/Problems

* Enables you to use existing matcher classes from projects like
  valid\_attribute and capybara
* Can be used both in MiniTest::Unit::TestCase & MiniTest::Spec

## Synopsis

see example matcher: [matcher.rb](https://github.com/bcardarella/valid_attribute/blob/master/lib/valid_attribute/matcher.rb)

```ruby
require "minitest/matchers"
require "minitest/autorun"
require "valid_attribute"
require "active_model"

class Post
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  attr_accessor :title
  validates :title, :presence => true, :length => 4..20
end

# Using minitest/unit

class PostTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
  include ValidAttribute::Method

  def test_validations
    post = Post.new

    assert_must have_valid(:title).when("Good"), post
    assert_wont have_valid(:title).when(""), post
  end
end

# Using minitest/spec

describe Post do
  include ValidAttribute::Method

  it "should have validations" do
    post = Post.new

    post.must have_valid(:title).when("Good")
    post.wont have_valid(:title).when("")
  end
end

# Using minitest/spec with subject

describe Post do
  subject { Post.new }

  it { must have_valid(:title).when("Hello") }
  it { wont have_valid(:title).when("", nil, "Bad") }
end

# or

describe Post do
  subject { Post.new }

  must { have_valid(:title).when("Hello") }
  wont { have_valid(:title).when("", nil, "Bad") }
end
```

You can also register matcher so that it works similar to built-in
assertions and expectations. Note subject must be the first argument in assertion.

```ruby
MiniTest::Unit::TestCase.register_matcher HaveContent, :have_content
MiniTest::Unit::TestCase.register_matcher :have_selector, :have_selector

assert_have_content page, "Hello"
assert_have_selector page, :xpath, "//table/tr"

page.must_have_content "Hello"
page.must_have_selector :xpath, "//table/tr"
```

## Requirements

* `minitest >= 2.7.0`

## Install

```
gem install minitest-matchers
```

or add to Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'minitest-matchers'
end
```
