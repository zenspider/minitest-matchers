= minitest-matchers

* http://github.com/zenspider/minitest-matchers

== DESCRIPTION:

minitest-matchers adds support for RSpec/Shoulda-style matchers to
minitest/unit and minitest/spec.

A matcher is a class that must implement #description, #matches?,
#failure_message and #negative_failure_message methods.
Expactations are then builded using these methods.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Enables you to use existing matcher classes from projects like
  valid_attribute, (with some additional work) shoulda-matchers and remarkable.

== SYNOPSIS:

* see example matcher: https://github.com/bcardarella/valid_attribute/blob/master/lib/valid_attribute/matcher.rb

    gem "minitest"
    require "minitest/matchers"
    require "minitest/autorun"
    require "valid_attribute"
    require "active_model"

    class Post
      include ActiveModel::Validations
      attr_accessor :title
      validates :title, :presence => true, :length => 4..20
    end

    # Using minitest/unit

    class PostTest < MiniTest::Unit::TestCase
      include ValidAttribute::Method

      def test_validations
        post = Post.new

        assert_must have_valid(:title).when("Good"), post
        assert_wont have_valid(:title).when(""), post
      end
    end

    # Using minitest/spec

    describe Post do
      include ValidAttribute::Method

      it "should have validations" do
        post = Post.new

        post.must have_valid(:title).when("Good")
        post.wont have_valid(:title).when("")
      end
    end

    # Using minitest/spec with subject

    describe Post do
      subject { Post.new }

      it { must have_valid(:title).when("Hello") }
      it { wont have_valid(:title).when("", nil, "Bad") }
    end
